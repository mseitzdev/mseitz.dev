            I was first introduced to writing Android apps 
            in the course COMP 2161 at Thompson Rivers University, 
            where I wrote a variety of apps under the instruction of 
            my professor, Musfiq Rahman. My two favorite app projects 
            from this course are my 
            <a href="busSimulator.php"> Transit System Simulator </a>
            , which was my final project in the course, and the
            <a href="androidCalc.php"> Scientific Calculator</a>
            , which was my first real GUI program. 
            With my professor's permission, I am showing you these 
            programs here.

            I look forward to writing more android apps, and have 
            been talking with a friend about some ideas for an app 
            that would be useful for frankenphone users to analyze 
            and manage non-stock battery configurations on their phones. 
            We're both a little busy as of late, but that's likely 
            how I'll dip back into android development if I ever return.
