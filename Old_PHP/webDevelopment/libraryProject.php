            During my internship search, I was offered a chance to do a coding project for Second Bind, and 
            put this website together. It's a full-stack website built with PHP, SQL, HTML, Javascript, and CSS.
            This website allows you to manage the library database by creating, sorting, and searching books in 
            a database. You can also export these sorted lists as JSON files. 
            It only took me a few hours to build this library from the code I wrote for 
            <a href="mseitzDotDev.php">This Portfolio</a>
            & the <a href="CSS_Store.php">CSS Store</a> 
            project I made for school.
            Building this made me realize that I've gotten to a much more comfortable place with web 
            development compared to where I started.
            <a href="https://github.com/mseitzdev/Library_Project"> 
            You can see this project on GitHub here.
            </a>
            <br><br>
            It's a combination of the cleaned-up code and design of this portfolio 
            mixed with full-stack functionality like the CSS Store. Although I still wouldn't consider 
            this project code to be production quality due to the lack of input sanitation and validation testing, 
            I enjoyed making it because it gave me a chance to mix the improved UI development skills I've 
            developed making this portfolio with the takeaway lessons & LAMP stack experience I got from the
            CSStore project. 
            <br><br>
            Making this library site made me feel like jumping back into LAMP development and developing something
            with the accounts, orders, & other breadth of functionality of the CSS Store project, but with better 
            usability & UI like this library and the portfolio website you're reading this on. I've learned enough 
            now, so if I get the time I think I'll make a foruth website better than the ones I've made so far.
